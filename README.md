# DIP_Webpage

## Introduction
This is a simple interface for running Digital Image Processing (DIP) or Computer Vision (CV) algorithms (in DIP.py) on a website, developed using Python.

I deployed it on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), a cloud-based Python development and hosting platform.

`PythonAnywhere` allows you to write, run, and host Python applications online without local setup. It supports frameworks like Flask, Django, and others, simplifying web development. With both free and paid plans, it's suitable for projects of all sizes.

This project uses Flask for both back-end and front-end website development. You can access the website at [https://dseclusioner.pythonanywhere.com/](https://dseclusioner.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Tools
| Library       | Version   |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Flask         | 2.1.2     |
| NumPy         | 1.25.2    |
| OpenCV (cv2)  | 4.5.4.60  |

Python version: 3.10.5

## Running the Code
To test the code locally, clone this repository and run `app.py`:

```bash
python app.py
```

You can then access the index.html file at http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your computer's web browser.
